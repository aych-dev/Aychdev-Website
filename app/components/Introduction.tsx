        My name is Henry Dominguez and I go by the alias Aychdev (eych-dev)
        online. I am a self-taught developer interested in all things blockchain
        and web/app development. I am currently learning how to implement Solana
        blockchain applications on the front-end and have an interest in soon
        learning Rust. I love that my work feels meaningful and I really enjoy
        helping upcoming aspiring developers. More than anything, I want my
        story to inspire people to believe in their potential regardless of what
        they might feel or hear from others. Do not hesitate to reach out!
