            One of my passions is creating video content and I have found a way
            to implement it into my coding journey. I've been documenting my
            journey since day 1 not only to look back on to see my progress, but
            to show a side that I think a lot of aspring developers can relate
            too. This journey can come with a mix of emotions sometimes more
            negative than positive, but I hope that my content can be a reminder
            that they are not alone and to keep staying resilient ðŸ’ª. If you
            want to follow along feel free to shoot me a follow on tok or
            Twitter.
